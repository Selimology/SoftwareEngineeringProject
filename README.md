# Grand Real Estate
## Real Estate Management System

### Project Description
This is a web platform which would help buyers to look at the available properties with photographs, description and necessary specifications. Since any website that isn’t UX friendly may push potential buyers away, we’ll be focusing on providing easy to use and attractive interface for both the seller and the buyer. Not only that, after quite a through market research we have noticed is that the majority of the Albanian real estate sites do not provide an accurate search engine. We’ll be focusing on developing a powerful search engine that provides accurate GPS location and listing details. Apart from this features, we’ll like to make sure everything is automated as much as possible. We’ll like to make the process of renting/selling a house only a click away. On top of it, we will also be ensuring a quick support availability. This will ensure the both buyers and sellers a way to communicate to someone when they are needing help.
